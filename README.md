## Chitter Challenge

Welcome to Chitter ~~not a clone of Twitter~~


## Set up

To setup the database:

* Connect to psql
* Create the database using the psql command `CREATE DATABASE chitter;`
* Connect to the database using the psql command `\c chitter`;
* Run the query saved in the file 01_create_chitter_table.sql
* Populate your table with a row by running `INSERT INTO peeps (message) values ('This is a peep!');`

To check you have everything set up ok, please take a look at the peeps table inside the chitter database. You should see one row in there.  

## Testing

* Connect to psql
* Create the database using the psql
command `CREATE DATABASE chitter_test;`;
* Connect to the database using the psql command `\c chitter_test`
* Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_chitter_table.sql

* `bundle install`
* `rspec`
