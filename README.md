## Chitter Challenge

We are going to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

## Set up

To setup the database:

* Connect to psql
* Create the database using the psql command `CREATE DATABASE chitter;`
* Connect to the database using the psql command `\c chitter`;
* Run the query saved in the file 01_create_chitter_table.sql and 02_create_user_table.sql

To setup the test database:
* Connect to psql
* Create the database using the psql
command `CREATE DATABASE chitter_test;`;
* Connect to the database using the psql command `\c chitter_test`
* Run the query saved in the file 01_create_chitter_table.sql and 02_create_user_table.sql


* `bundle install`
* `rspec`
