## Chitter Challenge

* This is the Chitter Challenge and the ask was to build a small twitter clone that allows users to post messages to a public stream.

## User stories

```
As a Maker
So that I can see what people are doing
I want to see all the messages (peeps)
in a browser
```

```
As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter
```

```
As a Maker
So that I can see when people are doing things
I want to see the date the message was posted
```
(Hint the database table will need to change to store the date too)

```
As a Maker
So that I can easily see the latest peeps
I want to see a list of peeps in reverse chronological order
```
```
As a Maker
So that I can find relevant peeps
I want to filter on a specific keyword
```

```
Additional functionalities have been added for users to register and log in into their account to post peeps
