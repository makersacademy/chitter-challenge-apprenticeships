Log in created. The user will be able to enter their username to enter the site. This was created with the intention of eventually being able to create account with usernames and passwords so that you can see who posted which Peeps
```
```
When on the home page the user can view all of the peeps that have been made, with the date that they were posted. This has been formatted to show the peeps in date descending order.
```
```
The user can post a new peep by clicking on the 'Make a new peep' button which takes them to a new view which adds their peep to the database and takes them back to the homepage.
```
```
If the user enters a peep that is too long, it will raise an error on the front page.
```
```
User can search for a keyword and will view a list of all of the results
